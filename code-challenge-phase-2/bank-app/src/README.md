This is a React functional component called "App". It imports the useState and useEffect hooks from the React library, as well as a custom Form component and a CSS file.

The component has two state variables: "transactions" and "search". "transactions" is initialized as an empty array and will be populated with data fetched from the server using the useEffect hook. "search" is an empty string and will be updated with the search input entered by the user.

The useEffect hook is used to fetch data from the server at the component mount stage. The fetched data is then set as the value of "transactions" using the setTransactions function.

There is an "addTransaction" function that takes in a new transaction object as an argument and adds it to the "transactions" state array using the spread operator.

The component renders a search input and a table that displays transaction data. The table is populated with data filtered based on the "search" state variable. The "Form" component is also rendered, which allows users to add new transactions.

Overall, this component renders a table of transactions, allows users to search for transactions based on description, and provides a way for users to add new transactions
